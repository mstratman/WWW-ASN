NAME
    WWW::ASN - Retrieve learning objectives from Achievement Standards
    Network

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::ASN;

        my $asn = WWW::ASN->new({
            jurisdictions_cache => './jurisdictions.xml',
        });
        for my $jurisdiction (@{ $asn->jurisdictions }) {
            if ($jurisdictions->name =~ /Common Core/i) {
                my @standards_docs = $jurisdictions->documents({ status => 'published' })
                ...
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to retrieve standards documents from the
    Achievement Standards Network (http://asn.jesandco.org/).

    As illustrated in the SYNOPSIS, you will typically first retrieve a
    jurisdiction such as a state, or other organization that creates
    standards documents. From this jurisdiction you can then retrieve
    specific documents.
