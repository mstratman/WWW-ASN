=head1 NAME

WWW::ASN::Jurisdiction - Represents a state, organization, or other entity that publishes standards

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WWW::ASN;

    my $asn = WWW::ASN->new();
    for my $jurisdiction ($asn->jurisdictions) {
        say $jurisdiction->name,
            " ( ", $jurisdiction->abbreviation, ")",
            " Type: ", $jurisdiction->type,
            " id: ", $jurisdiction->id;

        foreach my $document (@{ $jurisdiction->documents }) {
            ...;
        }
    }


=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 abbreviation

B<Required>.  An abbreviation for the jurisdiction.

e.g. "AL", "CCSS"

=head2 name

The name of the jurisdiction.  This is typically the state or organization name.

e.g. "Alabama", "Common Core State Standards"

=head2 type

e.g. "U.S. States and Territories", "Organization", "Country"

=head2 id

This is a globally unique URI for this jurisdiction.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 documents

    my @docs = @{
        $jurisdiction->documents({
            status => 'published',
        })
    };

Returns an array reference of L<WWW::ASN::Document> objects.

Optionally, this method accepts a hash reference containing any
of the following arguments:

=over 4

=item status

Can be one of: C<published>, C<draft>, or C<deprecated>.

Alternatively, you may provide C<statusURI> (but don't worry
if you don't know what this is).

=item subject

Can be a L<WWW::ASN::Subject> object or the string name of the subject.

States and other standards jurisdictions often are not very consistent, and may have
documents categorized under a number of very similar subjects. In general, this
option is not terribly useful for searching (e.g. don't search for "math" with
the expectation that you're receiving all math-related standards documents).

Alternatively, you may provide C<subjectURI> (but don't worry
if you don't know what this is).

=item cache_file

Path to a file used as a cache for this search.

The name of a file containing the XML data from
the last time this was called with the same
jurisdiction, subject, and status options.
e.g.
http://asn.jesandco.org/api/1/documents?...

If the file does not exist, it will be created.
