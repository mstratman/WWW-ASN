NAME
    WWW::ASN - Retrieve learning objectives from Achievement Standards
    Network

SYNOPSIS
    Without using caches:

        use WWW::ASN;

        my $asn = WWW::ASN->new;
        for my $jurisdiction (@{ $asn->jurisdictions }) {
            # $jurisdiction is a WWW::ASN::Jurisdiction object

            if ($jurisdictions->name =~ /Common Core/i) {
                for my $document (@{ $jurisdictions->documents({ status => 'published' }) }) {
                    # $document is a WWW::ASN::Document object

                    for my $standard (@{ $document->standards }) {
                        # $standard is a WWW::ASN::Standard document
                        print $standard->identifier, ": ", $standard->text;
                        ...
                        for my $sub_standard (@{ $standard->child_standards }) {
                            ...
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

    Another example, With cache files (recommended, if possible):

        use WWW::ASN;
        use URI::Escape qw(uri_escape);

        my $asn = WWW::ASN->new({
            jurisdictions_cache => 'jurisdictions.xml',
            subjects_cache      => 'subjects.xml',
        });
        for my $jurisdiction (@{ $asn->jurisdictions }) {
            my $docs_cache = 'doclist_' . $jurisdiction->abbreviation . '.xml';
            for my $doc (@{ $jurisdictions->documents({ cache_file => $docs_cache }) }) {
                # Set these cache values before calling standards()
                $doc->details_cache_file(
                    "doc_" . $jurisdiction->abbreviation . '_details_' . uri_escape($doc->id)
                );
                $doc->manifest_cache_file(
                    "doc_" . $jurisdiction->abbreviation . '_manifest_' . uri_escape($doc->id);
                );
                for my $standard (@{ $document->standards }) {
                    # $standard is a WWW::ASN::Standard document
                    ...
                    for my $sub_standard (@{ $standard->child_standards }) {
                        ...
                    }
                }
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to retrieve standards documents from the
    Achievement Standards Network (http://asn.jesandco.org/).

    As illustrated in the SYNOPSIS, you will typically first retrieve a
    jurisdiction such as a state, or other organization that creates
    standards documents. From this jurisdiction you can then retrieve
    specific documents.

    Note: Because this is such a niche module and there aren't many expected
    users, some of the documentation may take for granted your familiarity
    with the Achievement Standards Network. If you have difficulties using
    this module, please feel free to contact the author with any questions

  Cache files
    Many of the methods in these modules allow for the use of cache files.
    The main purpose of these options is to allow you to be a good citizen
    and avoid unnecessary hits to the ASN website during your development
    and testing.

    Using them is very simple: Just provide a file name. That's it!

    When a filename is provided it will be used instead of downloading the
    data again - unless the file doesn't exist, in which case the data will
    be downloaded and saved to the file.

ATTRIBUTES
  jurisdictions_cache
    Optional. The name of a file containing the XML data from
    http://asn.jesandco.org/api/1/jurisdictions

    If the file does not exist, it will be created.

    Leave this option undefined to force retrieval each time jurisdictions
    is called.

  subjects_cache
    Optional. The name of a file containing the XML data from
    http://asn.jesandco.org/api/1/subjects

    If the file does not exist, it will be created.

    Leave this option undefined to force retrieval each time subjects is
    called.

METHODS
    In addition to get/set methods for each of the attributes above, the
    following methods can be called:

  jurisdictions
    Returns an array reference of WWW::ASN::Jurisdiction objects.

  subjects
    Returns an array reference of WWW::ASN::Subject objects.

TODO
    *   Currently you need to start with a jurisdiction (either from calling
        `jurisdictions' on a `WWW::ASN' object, or by creating one with an
        `abbreviation' attribute (and optionally other attributes), then
        looping its documents, then fetching their standards.

        Ideally the interface should give you more direct routes to get to
        the data you're interested in.

    *   When a document creates a WWW::ASN::Standard object, it has to fetch
        two documents, the "details" xml and the "manifest" json.

        Ideally this would get everything from the "details" document. We
        use both though, since it's simpler and took less time to parse the
        manifest than the xml.

    *   Investigate the feasibility of interfacing with the SPARQL endpoint
        to allow for more powerful queries.

        e.g. get a list of recently updated documents.
